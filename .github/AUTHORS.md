## Elide Project Authors

This file lists the Elide project authors. A contributor is considered an _author_ to the extent their contributions are
significant enough to impact copyright considerations. This is left to the discretion of project authors but typically
applies when a full feature is contributed by a single author.

### Sam Gammon (@sgammon)

Sam is the original author of Elide and the primary maintainer. He is the code-owner by default unless otherwise
specified. All administrative rights have been delegated to second parties. The previous major versions of Elide, `v1`
and `v2`, were authored by Sam in Python and Java/Kotlin before being retired for Elide's current implementation.

### Dario Valdespino (@darvld)

Dario is a core contributor and maintainer of Elide. He is the code-owner and author of the Express JS intrinsics and
the serving engine.
