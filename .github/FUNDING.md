## Sponsoring the Elide Team

We support sponsorship of our open-source activities via GitHub and Patreon. Sponsoring us helps us pay for things like CI/CD, source control, and linting tools, which, collectively, turn into much better runtime features.

There is a portion of Elide's work which is commercial in nature. These donations are never deployed for commercial activities.

### Donating with something in mind

If you have an idea, or a bug, or a feature, that you'd like to see implemented, donating can help secure some developer time to get it done. Joining us on Discord is completely free, of course, and we do our best even if you can't donate!
