# Elide Project Governance

**The Elide project is an open source software framework and runtime.** It is supported in part by [Elide][1] the
company, which is known formally as _Elide Technologies, Inc._, a registered Delaware Limited Liability Company. Elide
is also supported by contributions from independent engineers all over the world.

Elide is a community project, and we welcome new contributors. We are committed to fostering a welcoming environment.
We expect contributors to follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct][2] when discussing the project in any forum.

## Project Leadership

The Elide project is led by a core team of authors. The current authorship includes:

- **Sam Gammon (@sgammon)**: Primary author and maintainer of Elide. Code-owner by default unless otherwise noted.
- **Dario Valdespino (@darvld)**: Core contributor and maintainer of Elide. Code-owner and author of the Express JS
  intrinsics and the serving engine.

## Process and Governance

Most design and development discussion happens via [GitHub Discussions][3] in an open manner where anybody can join in.
Proposals typically form in that area and move to a place of consensus before any implementation work begins.

Once a proposal has been made and a consensus has been reached, the core team will work with the author(s) to determine
the best path forward. This may include the author(s) implementing the proposal, or it may fall to the core team to
implement the proposal.

### Code review

During the development process, code review is done via GitHub pull requests. The core team reviews and merges all pull
requests. Contributors may opt to keep their pull requests as drafts until such time as they are ready for review.

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Elide requires that all contributors **sign their commits** with a valid cryptographic key registered to their GitHub
account and email address. **All commits** must also carry a `Signed-off-by` tag in order to be considered for merge.
This tag indicates that the contributor has read and agreed to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)][4].

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Elide requires that all contributors agree to the terms of the [Elide Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][5]. This
agreement clarifies intellectual property rights with regard to the Elide Framework and Runtime. It does not change your
rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.
