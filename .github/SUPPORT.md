# Elide Support & Community

Support for use of Elide and for library embedders is available via the following channels:

### GitHub Issues

We use [GitHub Issues][1] as our issue tracker. If you've found a bug, or want to request a feature, this is the right
place to do it. We check the issue tracker frequently.

### GitHub Discussions

We use [GitHub Discussions][2] for general questions, feature requests, and other, longer-form collaboration. If you
have a question or want to propose a large change to Elide, this is the right place to do it. We check discussions
frequently and participate in them ourselves; this is typically how _we_ propose changes to Elide internally, too.

### Stack Overflow

We don't yet have a dedicated tag on StackOverflow, but if you file a question and link it from a bug here, we'll work
to create one and do our best to answer it in a timely manner.

### Slack

We have our Slack server which we can link to your Slack server. File an issue to request a Slack Connect invite. We are
happy to do this for anyone.

**On the Kotlin Slack,** we have the `#elide-framework` room. This room is also public so it's easy to join. You can
request an invite to the Kotlin Slack from the [Kotlin Community][4] page.

### Discord

We have a home [Discord server][3] (`nullclub`), where the `#elide` room is dedicated to Elide. We check Discord
frequently and hang out in there ourselves; this is the best way to get ahold of the developers directly, probably.

### Commercial Support

If you're interested in commercial support, please contact us via any of the above methods. We're focused on shipping
apps with Elide for the most part, but we're happy to work something out if you need it.
