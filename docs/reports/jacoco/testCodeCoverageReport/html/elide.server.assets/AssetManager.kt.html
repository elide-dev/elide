/**
 * Describes the API surface of an *Asset Manager*, which controls access to embedded server-side assets such as CSS and
 * JS documents.
 *
 * The asset manager is responsible for maintaining a runtime registry of all available assets, which is typically built
 * at server startup. Assets should be held in memory so they may easily be resolved, dynamically transformed, and
 * ultimately served to end-users through either user-defined controllers or the built-in asset controller.
 *
 * ### Asset descriptors
 *
 * During the app build, the Elide build tools package scripts for use with SSR or client-side serving. After packaging
 * assets from internal and external builds, protocol buffer descriptors are computed and embedded in the application,
 * which describe how each asset should be served, addressed, and treated with regard to dependencies.
 *
 * At server startup, the encoded descriptors are loaded, assets are interpreted and loaded, and the server refers to
 * the resulting mapping when called upon to serve assets.
 *
 * ### Offloading
 *
 * Static assets do exist on disk, technically, but when embedded in an application JAR or native image, they are
 * automatically zipped and inlined into the application binary. Therefore, OS-level tools like `sendfile` aren't an
 * option.
 *
 * However, Micronaut and KotlinX Coroutines both have built-in IO scheduling support, which is usually backed by a pool
 * of cached POSIX threads. This offers a good alternative for offloading I/O from a user-defined request handler.
 *
 * ### Customizing the asset system
 *
 * The [AssetManager] is a simple interface which mediates between an [AssetResolver] and [AssetReader] implementation
 * pair to serve assets at mapped HTTP paths. In some cases, the developer may want to customize this behavior, either
 * in the way asset paths are translated or interpreted (via a custom [AssetResolver]), or the way asset content is
 * loaded and returned (via a custom [AssetReader]). Both can be used at once if needed.
 *
 * To customize a given asset system component, use the `Replaces` annotation from Micronaut's context module. For
 * example:
 * ```kotlin
 * package your.package.here;
 *
 * import elide.server.assets.AssetReader;
 * import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Replaces;
 *
 * @Replaces(ServerAssetReader::class)
 * public class MyCoolAssetReader: AssetReader {
 *   // (impl here)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The [AssetManager] participates in the DI container, so the developer only needs to provide a component definition.
 * Later, when an [AssetManager] instance is requested by the app, the main implementation will load and use the
 * developer's custom implementation.
 *
 * @see AssetResolver which is responsible for checking, translating, and loading asset paths.
 * @see AssetReader which is responsible for reading asset content efficiently.
 * @see RenderedAsset for the generic return value model leveraged by [AssetManager].
 * @see ServerAsset for the symbolic asset reference model leveraged by [AssetManager].

   * This method is the core of the runtime portion of the asset system. When an asset is requested via an endpoint
   * managed by the [AssetController], it effectively calls into this method, after resolving the asset, in order to

   *
   * [StreamedAssetResponse] is mapped to Netty/Micronaut classes under the hood which are optimal for serving static
   * asset data.
   *
   * ### Dynamic asset transformation
   *
   * If the asset must be transformed before being returned, especially in some computationally-expensive manner, then
   * the underlying method should switch out to the I/O scheduler (or some other scheduler) in order to avoid any
   * blocking behavior.
