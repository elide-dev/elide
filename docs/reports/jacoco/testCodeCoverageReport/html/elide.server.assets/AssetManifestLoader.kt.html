/**
 * Defines the API surface of a loader which is capable of searching for an asset manifest at server startup, and then
 * de-serializing the manifest, so it can be indexed and then made available via an [AssetManager] implementation.
 *
 * The manifest loader is responsible only for two things:
 * 1. **Locating** the manifest on the classpath, if it exists, from a given or default set of candidate locations.
 * 2. **De-serializing** the manifest from some known format, and producing the result as an [AssetBundle].
 *
 * At server startup, the default set of manifest locations ([assetManifestCandidates]) is searched unless otherwise
 * specified by the developer.
 *
 * ### Implementation
 *
 * Typically, this interface is implemented by [ServerAssetManifestProvider]. The developer may replace this default
 * implementation using the `@Replaces` annotation from Micronaut. For example:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @Replaces(ServerAssetManifestProvider::class)
 * class MyAssetManifestProvider : AssetManifestLoader {
 *   // implementation here
 * }
 * ```
