 * Marks a class as "context"-phase for purposes of dependency injection. Classes marked with this annotation are
 * initialized eagerly on application startup.
 *
 * When used on JVM platforms, this annotation is translated into a Micronaut `Context` annotation:

 *
 * @see Eager which behaves similarly.
