# Lockfiles

Elide project lockfiles are stored in the `dev root` (typically `./.dev`). By default, a project lockfile is expressed
in binary form, using the filename `elide.lock.bin` (so, that's `./.dev/elide.lock.bin` by default).

Binary lockfiles are quick to parse, and this is great because parsing the lockfile typically happens on every call to
Elide which runs code. On the other hand, in some contexts, one may prefer JSON.

## Selecting a Format

To select JSON as a lockfile format, add the following block to `elide.pkl`:
```pkl
lockfile {
  format = "json"
}
```

Or, delete any current lockfile, and pass `--lockfile-format` to `--install`:
```bash
elide install --lockfile-format=json
```

## What's in the lockfile?

Elide's lockfile format stores fingerprints of key data and files in the project:

- "Foreign lockfiles": for example, lockfiles generated by Node tooling, like `package-lock.kdl`
- Dependency Manifests: Foreign dependency manifests, such as `package.json` or `pom.xml`
- Dependency Inputs: The actual files (JARs, etc.) that are used as inputs to the build

Lockfiles are not machine-specific; the paths held in lockfiles are resolvable on any machine using Elide.

Lockfile content may change based on how you use Elide. If you don't use Maven, there won't be a Maven section within
your project's lockfile.
