/**
 * The Polyglot Context is the core of the Elide runtime: it evaluates guest code in the embedded VM, returning the
 * execution result. Context instances can be [acquired][PolyglotEngine.acquire] from a [PolyglotEngine].
 *
 * Contexts are fully generic, meaning they do not impose constraints on the nature of the guest code (as long as the
 * requested language is supported by the context), nor do they infer any execution details from it. This allows
 * specific use cases such as SSR to be built using the context API without coupling.
 *
 * ### Configuration
 *
 * Contexts can be configured using [plugins][EnginePlugin] that subscribe to the
 * [ContextCreated][EngineLifecycleEvent.ContextCreated] event and update the provided [PolyglotContextBuilder].
 *
 * Plugins are installed into the [engine][PolyglotEngine] when it is initialized, and will receive an event for every
 * context issued by [acquire][PolyglotEngine.acquire].
 *
 * ### Guest code execution
 *
 * To evaluate and execute a unit of guest code, call [evaluate] indicating the target [GuestLanguage] and source, the
 * returned [PolyglotValue] will contain the result of the execution, depending on the context configuration.
