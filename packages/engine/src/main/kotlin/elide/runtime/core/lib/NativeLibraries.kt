 * # Native Libraries
 *
 * Utility for loading native libraries within the context of either a JVM or an SVM (native) application; SVM requires
 * certain steps to be performed, or to be skipped, based on dynamic or static linkage of libraries.
 *
 * Static libraries are built-in to the native image ahead of time, and their load calls should be skipped at runtime.
 * Dynamic libraries are loaded via normal JVM means.
