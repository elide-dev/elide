/**
 * # Execution Engine
 *
 * Implements the JVM surface of the `exec` crate, which is responsible for managing a Tokio engine that is used for
 * multithreaded and async execution within native contexts.
 *
 * The execution engine is also integrated with the `trace` crate, which provides trace subscribes that bridge back to
 * JVM for event delivery.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Load the native `exec` library and initialize the layer by calling [ensureLoaded]; this method is idempotent and will
 * throw if errors occur. After this point, native methods on [Execution] or [Tracing] can be used directly.
 *
 * @see Tracing Execution tracing support
