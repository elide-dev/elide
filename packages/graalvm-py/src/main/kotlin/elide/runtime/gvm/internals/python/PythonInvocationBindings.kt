/**
 * # Python: Invocation Bindings
 *
 * Implementation of [InvocationBindings] for the Python runtime provided by Elide, and powered by GraalVM; this class
 * is charged with resolving a set of invocation bindings from an input script and evaluated [GuestValue] pair. This
 * involves interrogating the result of executing the user's guest code entrypoint, matching to an invocation style, and
 * then wiring together appropriate bindings to dispatch those symbols.
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ## Supported dispatch styles
 *
 * Python guest code can be invoked in a number of different ways, depending on the shape of the exported bindings and
 * the intended purpose of the guest application. The simplest option is to run as if `__main__` was invoked, and to
 * print content back to the output buffer.
 *
 * Main invocation is only recommended for very small scripts because: (1) it generally doesn't scale well, (2) it's
 * impossible to accept structured inputs without serialization, and (3) it complicates debugging, maintainability, and
 * performance.
 *
 * There is also a "server" dispatch style, which invokes an entrypoint dedicated to processing HTTP requests. If the
 * user is using Elide's provided Flask-style API, this entrypoint is configured and used automatically.
 *
 * An entrypoint function can be "exported" to the Elide runtime by annotating it with <TBD>.
 *
 * **Exhaustive list of dispatch styles supported by the Python runtime:**
 * TBD.
 *
 * ### Unary binding example
 *
 * TBD.
 *
 * ### Server binding example
 *
 * TBD.
 *
 * ## Render binding style
 *
 * TBD.
 *
 * ## Safety of bindings
 *
 * [PythonInvocationBindings] are tied to the VM context which they originate from. This means that execution of
 * bindings, and indeed even interrogating binding values, must be confined to the same native thread as the VM context.
 * For this reason, it is expected that only the VM implementation will touch internal binding state.
 *
 * @param modes Supported dispatch modes for this invocation bindings instance.
 * @param mapped Resolved values for each binding.
 * @param types Entrypoint types expressed in [mapped].
