/**
 * # GraalVM: Invocation bindings.
 *
 * Abstract base implementation of [InvocationBindings] based on GraalVM guest values ([GuestValue]). Guest invocation
 * bindings describe methods for invoking guest code from Elide. Invocation bindings are specialized per-language, but
 * generally map to a uniform set of "dispatch modes;" these modes describe, in basic language-agnostic form, how guest
 * code should be called.
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ## Dispatch modes
 *
 * Dispatch modes supported on GraalVM are enumerated in [DispatchStyle], and, at the time of this writing, include:
 *
 * - [DispatchStyle.UNARY]: Basic dispatch with one set of inputs and one output. In this mode, the guest VM executes
 *   in what amounts to be a "function." No output is available until the guest execution terminates.
 *
 * - [DispatchStyle.SERVER]: Dispatch of HTTP requests to the guest. Each HTTP request results in an invocation of the
 *   guest code. In this mode, the guest VM is entirely "in charge" of the request and response lifecycle. The server
 *   interface is wire-compatible with CloudFlare Workers.
 *
 * - [DispatchStyle.RENDER]: Sidecar dispatch of SSR render code, which is designed to operate in tandem with another
 *   guest or the host application. In this mode, the primary output is effectively a big string (although it may be
 *   streamed in chunks). In this mode, the guest VM is charged with rendering output based on input, but is not
 *   ultimately authoritative over the response or the request lifecycle.
