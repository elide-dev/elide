/**
 * Implementation of a JavaScript Promise object that can be completed at will by host code.
 *
 * ### Semantics of Promise instances
 *
 * Promise objects should be viewed as 'slots' where future values will be stored, rather than a direct encapsulation
 * of async code. The semantics of this implementation are closer to that of Kotlin's
 * [CompletableDeferred][kotlinx.coroutines.CompletableDeferred], with the completable API only being available to the
 * host, since the promise itself does not invoke or track the execution of any code, but is instaed used by other code
 * to notify consumers about completion.
 *
 * ### Concurrency and guest callbacks
 *
 * Guest code may register callbacks on a promise from any thread, which can cause issues where a Promise attempts to
 * invoke a callback on a guest context that is in use at the time of completion. This problem will be solved by the
 * guest executor API, which will provide ways to pin the execution of code to a specific guest context.
