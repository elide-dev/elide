/**
 * # Guest VM: JavaScript
 *
 * Convenience entrypoints into JavaScript guest types, including JS embedded and literal scripts. After obtaining an
 * [ExecutableScript] instance, guest code can be executed by calling any of the "execute" methods present on a
 * JavaScript Runtime instance. These may be obtained from the relevant VM facade factory.
 *
 * ## Literal scripts
 *
 * Literal code can be wrapped in an [ExecutableScript] via the [literal] family of methods, which accept string types,
 * [InputStream], and [Reader]. Literal code will be given a special file-name for debugging purposes.
 *
 * ## Embedded scripts
 *
 * Scripts embedded within the host application can be referenced via the [embedded] series of methods. "Embedded"
 * scripts are retrieved from the host app classpath via Elide's built-in asset mechanisms. These should usually be used
 * in tandem with Elide's Gradle plugin, or related build infrastructure, which packs embedded scripts into a consistent
 * place in the classpath.
 *
 * ## File scripts
 *
 * An external file can be loaded via the [file] series of methods. Note that these methods always pull from Host I/O,
 * as they are executed outside the guest VM. Once executing, a script can only "see" or access I/O according to the
 * applied guest I/O policy.
