/**
 * # Fetch: Response.
 *
 * Describes the structure of an HTTP response provided via the Fetch sub-system, which implements the WhatWG Fetch API
 * Standard, in both browser JavaScript engines and server-side JavaScript engines. The Fetch system and specification
 * are designed to make HTTP data fetches easy in JavaScript environments, and stand as a modern replacement for the
 * famous `XMLHttpRequest` API in browsers, and the `http`/`https` layers in NodeJS.
 *
 * Fetch responses model normal HTTP response structures, including a status code/status text, response headers, and a
 * response body, as applicable. Not all HTTP responses carry a response body. Responses can be used to model content
 * originating from a guest VM script (in the case of a generated or synthesized response, potentially in response to
 * input, such as an HTTP request), or used to model a response to originated requests, for example, when fetching data
 * from inside a VM and accessing the resulting response.
 *
 * From MDN:
 * "The Response interface of the Fetch API represents the response to a request. You can create a new Response object
 * using the Response() constructor, but you are more likely to encounter a Response object being returned as the result
 * of another API operationâ€”for example, a service worker FetchEvent.respondWith, or a simple fetch()."
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ## Use as execution output
 *
 * The [FetchResponse] interface is used, along with the [FetchRequest] interface, to model server-style invocation for
 * the JavaScript VM. In this case, a [FetchResponse] instance is expected as the output for a VM execution run, which
 * is seeded with a [FetchRequest] instance provided by the outer host server runtime.
 *
 * Multiple concrete [FetchResponse] implementations exist; each originate from a given server implementation.
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ## Use from a guest context
 *
 * Responses can be created from within a JavaScript guest, or received from within a guest context when executing a
 * fetched [FetchRequest] (host permissions permitting).
