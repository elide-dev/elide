 * Implements intrinsic JavaScript timers, at the familiar symbols `setTimeout` and `setInterval`; each method starts a
 * timer task which is dispatched after a specified delay. Interval timers repeat their execution until canceled, while
 * regular one-shot timers execute only once.
 *
 * Note that parameters are reversed for the host-side versions of these methods. JavaScript `setTimeout` takes the
 * callback value first, for example, and the delay second; [setTimeout] takes the delay first so that the callback can
 * use Kotlin's lambda syntax.
