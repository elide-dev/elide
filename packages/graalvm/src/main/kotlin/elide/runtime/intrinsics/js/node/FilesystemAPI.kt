/**
 * # Node API: `fs`
 *
 * Describes the API made available via Node's built-in `fs` module, which implements filesystem operations in both
 * synchronous and asynchronous (callback) forms.
 *
 * Facilities are provided for reading and writing files, as well as iterating over directories, handling links, and
 * managing file descriptors.
 *
 * In Elide, filesystem operations are implemented on top of VFS, and use GraalVM's embedded I/O isolation.
 * The "view" of a filesystem available to a guest application is the composed form of the VFS and the host filesystem,
 * modulo application permissions.
 *
 * VFS sources can be things like the host filesystem, tarballs, in-memory or embedded data, or even remote filesystems.
 * Other than Elide's implementation mechanics, the API behaves as identically as possible to Node's built-in module.
 *
 * Each method is generally specified with two implementations: one for host-side use (with host types), and one for
 * entirely guest-side use, which accepts either [Value] or [Any] objects.
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ## I/O Isolation
 *
 * Filesystem operations are subject to I/O isolation policy in Elide; this means that files may be visible on the host
 * system, or may not be.
 *
 * Additionally, filesystem operations may be restricted to read-only status, in which case the methods provided by the
 * [WritableFilesystemAPI] will either not be available or will throw as if denied by the operating system.
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ## Interaction with NIO
 *
 * Most I/O operations under the hood are implemented with JDK NIO, including path translation, file reading and writing
 * and directory traversal, and streams.
 *
 * NIO documentation can be consulted for more information on the underlying behavior of these operations:
 * [Java NIO Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/package-summary.html).
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ## Filesystem Paths
 *
 * This module makes extensive use of the [PathAPI] to resolve filesystem paths; operating system-specific path behavior
 * is defined in that module and documented there as well.
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * See [Node's `fs` documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) for more information.
 *
 * @see FilesystemPromiseAPI for a promise-based alternative to this API, made available at `fs/promises`.
 * @see WritableFilesystemAPI for writable extensions to this base API
