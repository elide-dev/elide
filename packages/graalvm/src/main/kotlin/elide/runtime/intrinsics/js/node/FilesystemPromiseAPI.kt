/**
 * # Node API: Filesystem (Promises)
 *
 * The `fs/promises` API provides asynchronous file system methods that return promises.
 *
 * The promise APIs use the underlying Node.js thread pool to perform file system operations off the event loop thread.
 * These operations are not synchronized or threadsafe. Care must be taken when performing multiple concurrent
 * modifications on the same file or data corruption may occur.
 *
 * @see FilesystemAPI for non-promise filesystem methods.

  /**
   * ## Method: `fs.access`
   *
   * Tests a user's permissions for the file or directory specified by [path]. The `mode` argument is an optional
   * integer that specifies the accessibility checks to be performed. `mode` should be either the value
   * `fs.constants.F_OK` or a mask consisting of the bitwise OR of any of `fs.constants.R_OK`,` fs.constants.W_OK`, and
   * `fs.constants.X_OK `(e.g. `fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.R_OK`).
   *
   * Check File access constants for possible values of ``ode].
   *
   * If the accessibility check is successful, the promise is fulfilled with no value. If any of the accessibility
   * checks fail, the promise is rejected with a [JsError] object. The following example checks if the file
   * `/etc/passwd` can be read and written by the current process:
   *
   * ```javascript
   * import { access, constants } from 'node:fs/promises';
   *
   * try {
   *   await access('/etc/passwd', constants.R_OK | constants.W_OK);
   *   console.log('can access');
   * } catch {
   *   console.error('cannot access');
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Using [access] to check for the accessibility of a file before calling [open] is not recommended. Doing so
   * introduces a race condition, since other processes may change the file's state between the two calls.
   *
   * Instead, user code should open/read/write the file directly and handle the error raised if the file is not
   * accessible.
   *
   * @param path The path to the file or directory.
   * @return A promise which resolves with no value if the file or directory exists, and rejects with an error if it
   *  does not.
