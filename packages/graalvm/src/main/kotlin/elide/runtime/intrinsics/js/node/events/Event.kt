/**
 * ## Node API: Event
 *
 * The [Event] object is an adaptation of the [Event Web API](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#event). Instances are created
 * internally by Elide.
 *
 * The root [Event] interface describes properties which are made available on all event types, regardless of how they
 * are created or used; application-level events should extend [CustomEvent] to gain [Event] implementation access.
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ### Event Properties
 *
 * Events, by nature, are always expected to _at least_ define a string [type] as their "event name," or "event type."
 * Listeners typically subscribe to events based on the [type] value.
 *
 * The event [type] can be a [String] or a [JsSymbol].
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ### Custom Events
 *
 * Applications that wish to dispatch or emit their own events can do so by either (1) extending [CustomEvent] and
 * overriding properties as needed; or (2) creating an instance of [CustomEvent] via the provided public constructor.
 *
 * Custom events can be initialized via their constructor, or via the [CustomEvent.initEvent] method.
