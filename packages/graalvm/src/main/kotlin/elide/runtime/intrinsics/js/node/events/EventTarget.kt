/**
 * ## Node API: Event Target
 *
 * The [EventTarget] and [Event] objects are a Node.js-specific implementation of the
 * [EventTarget Web API](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#eventtarget) that are exposed by some Node.js core APIs.
 *
 * The [EventTarget] interface is implemented by objects that can receive events and may have listeners for them; events
 * are dispatched via [dispatchEvent], and listeners are managed via [addEventListener] and [removeEventListener].
 *
 * Event targets are implementable from host code or guest code.
 *
 * Event targets in Node.js-style dispatch form differ slightly from web-standard event targets; see below for more
 * information.
 *
 * ### Node.js `EventTarget` vs. DOM `EventTarget`
 *
 * There are two key differences between the Node.js [EventTarget] and the
 * [EventTarget Web API](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#eventtarget):
 *
 * - Whereas DOM [EventTarget] instances may be hierarchical, there is no concept of hierarchy and event propagation in
 *   Node.js. That is, an event dispatched to an [EventTarget] does not propagate through a hierarchy of nested target
 *   objects that may each have their own set of handlers for the event.
 *
 * - In the Node.js [EventTarget], if an event listener is an async function or returns a `Promise`, and the returned
 *   `Promise` rejects, the rejection is automatically captured and handled the same way as a listener that throws
 *   synchronously (see [EventTarget] error handling docs for details).

   * option value.
   *
   * If the once option is `true`, the listener is removed after the next time a type event is dispatched.
   *
   * The `capture` option is not used by Node.js in any functional way other than tracking registered event listeners
   * per the [EventTarget] specification. Specifically, the `capture` option is used as part of the key when registering
   * a [listener]. Any individual [listener] may be added once with `capture = false`, and once with `capture = true`.
