 * An implementation of [HandlerRegistry] that keeps a per-thread backing map.

 * Whenever the registry is accessed for the first time on a given thread, the [initializeForThread] function is
 * called to obtain new thread-scoped references provided by guest code.
 *
 * By scoping handler references to the current thread, this registry guarantees that they can safely be used with a
 * similarly scoped context, avoiding the limitations on concurrency imposed by GraalVM's JavaScript engine and other
 * single-threaded guest languages.
