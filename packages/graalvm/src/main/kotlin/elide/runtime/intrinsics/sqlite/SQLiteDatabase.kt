/**
 * # SQLite Database
 *
 * Describes the concept of a database as driven by the SQLite engine; SQLite databases can be held in-memory, or backed
 * by a file which is persisted to disk.
 *
 * The [SQLiteDatabase] is the primary interface through which all database operations are performed, including queries,
 * transactions, and schema operations.
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ## Database Lifecycle
 *
 * There are essentially three phases to a SQLite database as understood by Elide: **initialized**, **opened**, and
 * **closed**.
 *
 * When the database is in an **initialized** state, it has not yet loaded data from disk or memory (via serialization).
 *
 * Initialization takes place immediately when the database object is created, and is guided by the configuration
 * parameters which can be provided to the constructor.
 *
 * The database moves almost immediately to an **opened** state, where it is ready to accept queries, transactions, or
 * deserialization from in-memory data.
 *
 * ```mermaid
 * graph TD
 *  A[Initialized] --> B[Opened]
 *  B --> C[Active]
 *  C --> C
 *  C --> D[Closed]
 * ```
 *
 * When the database is closed (via the [close] method), all associated resources are freed, and the database may no
 * longer be used for queries or transactions of any kind; such transactions (placed after close) throw unconditional
 * exceptions.
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ## Managed Resources
 *
 * All resources associated with a given SQLite database are managed by that database; this includes query ephemeral,
 * like prepared statements, transactions, and associated objects.
 *
 * When a database is closed, this tree of objects is closed (where applicable) in a reasonable order.
 *
 * After closing, resources are freed, with the only exception being result objects de-serialized for use in the user's
 * application.
 *
 * These objects remain alive so long as the user's application maintains references to them; database references held
 * by ephemeral objects are always weakly referenced.
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ## Guest Usage
 *
 * SQLite leverages a constrained set of primitive data types (see [SQLitePrimitiveType]) to represent data within user
 * tables; as a result, SQLite data types work well with guest code out of the box.
 *
 * Wrapping and boxing types, where required, use proxy interfaces so that they interoperate as expected with guest
 * code; by and large, Elide's SQLite API for guests follows Bun's API in JavaScript.
 *
 * @see SQLiteAPI Module-level SQLite API
 * @see SQLiteStatement Statement API
 * @see SQLiteTransaction Transaction API
