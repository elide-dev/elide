/**
 * # SQLite Statement
 *
 * Describes a SQLite query statement, potentially in prepared form, which can be executed against an active SQLite
 * database connection.
 *
 * This type is typically created by the [SQLiteDatabase] interface, as driven by user code, and then either executed in
 * one-shot form, or in repeated (prepared) form, as needed.
 *
 * SQLite statements hold their own resources, so they are [Closeable] and [AutoCloseable]; all statement except simple
 * one-shot statements are managed by their owning [SQLiteDatabase] instance.
 *
 * As a result, calling [SQLiteDatabase.close] will call [close] on any owned statements.
 *
 * @see SQLiteDatabase SQLite Database API
