/**
 * # SQLite Transactor
 *
 * Describes a function which is provided as a transactional closure to the SQLite driver; the transactor executes the
 * steps of the transaction itself, and may be subject to rollback or retries as determined by the engine.
 *
 * This type is typically not accessible directly by user code, but is instead consumed by the [SQLiteTransaction]
 * created by the driver to facilitate execution.
 *
 * &nbsp;
 *
 * ## Idempotency
 *
 * Because transactions are subject to rollback and retry, the transactor should be idempotent; that is, it should be
 * safe to execute the transaction multiple times without causing side effects.
 *
 * For more information about transaction behavior, see the [SQLiteTransaction] documentation.
 *
 * @param R Return value type.
 * @see SQLiteTransaction Transaction API
