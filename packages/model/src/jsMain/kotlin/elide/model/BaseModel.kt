/**
 * Describes the expected interface for model objects which are designated as records.
 *
 * Records, within the scope of an Elide application, are [AppModel] objects which comply with an extended set of API
 * guarantees:
 * - Like [AppModel] instances, [AppRecord]s must be paired to a [WireMessage] [M] (usually a protocol buffer message).
 * - Records must export some annotated field as their designated [id], which should resolve to a stable type [K].
 * - Where applicable, records must export their [parentId], which should resolve to a matching key type [K].
 * - Where applicable, records must export an annotated [displayName] field for use in form UIs and so forth.
 *
 * Additional extensions of the [AppRecord] type form supersets of these guarantees:
 * - [StampedRecord] instances carry [StampedRecord.createdAt] and [StampedRecord.updatedAt] timestamps.
 * - [VersionedRecord] instances carry a [VersionedRecord.version] property for optimistic concurrency control.
 *
 * Generally speaking, [AppModel] instances correspond with objects which are serialized and exchanged by an application
 * but are not always addressable or persistent. [AppRecord] objects are expected to be identified (perhaps with type
 * annotations), and typically correspond to database records which need CRUD-like operations.
