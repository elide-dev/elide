/**
 * Describes the possible states that a gRPC Web call outcome can take on, namely an error state and a success state
 * which provides one or more response payloads.
 *
 * This class works in concert with [GrpcWebCall] to track the status of calls to the backing gRPC server. If a
 * [GrpcWebCall] has a [GrpcWebCallResponse] object present, the call has completed processing.
 *
 * @param success Indicates whether the call was encountered an error, in which case the value will be `false`, and the
 *   implementation will be [Error], or a successful response, in which case the value will be `true` and the
 *   implementation will be an instance of [UnaryResponse].
