/**
 * # SSG: Static Compiler
 *
 * This class is responsible for the actual business logic of compiling a static site from generated requests, based on
 * the app's metadata. Requests are generated by the [AppLoader] in cooperation with the [RequestFactory]; with requests
 * and configured endpoints in hand, this class kicks in to recursively fulfill the full tree of requests.
 *
 * ## URL discovery
 *
 * To account for static assets and other handlers which are not marked as page controllers, additional URLs may be
 * added statically or discovered at runtime based on the returned HTML, which is parsed to discover these assets. As
 * URLs are discovered and deemed eligible for compilation, they are added to the queue of requests to be fulfilled,
 * which enqueues a new tree of requests within this class.
