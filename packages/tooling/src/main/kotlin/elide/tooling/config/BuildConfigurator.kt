/**
 * # Build Configurator
 *
 * Build configurators implement some independently-calculable suite of configuration functionality for Elide project
 * builds; for example, a configurator may be responsible for configuring build caching, or for compiling sources for a
 * given language.
 *
 * Build configurators are loaded via the JVM `ServiceLoader` mechanism, and are expected to be registered at build-time
 * in a no-param instantiable form. When configuring user builds, state is provided to the configurator, and it has a
 * chance to contribute build information, create graph tasks, and mount other configuration, such as dependency
 * resolver implementations.
 *
 * Project builds take place before execution (running, testing, and so on). Tests and execution are configured via
 * other means; see [TestConfigurator] for testing, and the CLI module for execution.
 *
 * @see BuildConfigurators build configurator loading and processing
 * @see TestConfigurator similar protocol but for project test configuration
