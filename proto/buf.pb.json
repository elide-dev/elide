The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on\n January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the\n Gregorian calendar backwards to year one.\n\n All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are \"smeared\" so that no leap\n second table is needed for interpretation, using a [24-hour linear\n smear](https://developers.google.com/time/smear).\n\n The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By\n restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from [RFC\n 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date strings.\n\n # Examples\n\n Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `time()`.\n\n     Timestamp timestamp;\n     timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL));\n     timestamp.set_nanos(0);\n\n Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `gettimeofday()`.\n\n     struct timeval tv;\n     gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);\n\n     Timestamp timestamp;\n     timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec);\n     timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);\n\n Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.\n\n     FILETIME ft;\n     GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft);\n     UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;\n\n     // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds.

That is, the\n format is \"{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z\"\n where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day},\n {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional\n seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution),\n are optional. The \"Z\" suffix indicates the timezone (\"UTC\"); the timezone\n is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by\n \"Z\") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be\n able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset).\n\n For example, \"2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z\" encodes 15.01 seconds past\n 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.\n\n In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the\n standard\n [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString)\n method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted\n to this format using\n [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with\n the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use\n the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`](\n http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime%2D%2D\n ) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.\n\n"},{"path":[4,0,1],"span":[132,8,17]},{"path":[4,0,2,0],"span":[136,2,20],"leadingComments":" Represents seconds of UTC time since Unix epoch\n 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

This is used whenever a set of elements are\n   logically enclosed in a single code segment.  For example, an entire\n   extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will\n   have an outer location whose path refers to the \"extensions\" repeated\n   field without an index.\n - Multiple locations may have the same path.  This happens when a single\n   logical declaration is spread out across multiple places.  The most\n   obvious example is the \"extend\" block again -- there may be multiple\n   extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path.\n - A location's span is not always a subset of its parent's span.  For\n   example, the \"extendee\" of an extension declaration appears at the\n   beginning of the \"extend\" block and is shared by all extensions within\n   the block.\n - Just because a location's span is a subset of some other location's span\n   does not mean that it is a descendant.  For example, a \"group\" defines\n   both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations\n   corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap.\n - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to\n   ignore those that it doesn't understand, as more types of locations could\n   be recorded in the future.\n"},{"path":[4,19,2,0,4],"span":[851,2,10]},{"path":[4,19,2,0,6],"span":[851,11,19]},{"path":[4,19,2,0,1],"span":[851,20,28]},{"path":[4,19,2,0,3],"span":[851,31,32]},{"path":[4,19,3,0],"span":[852,2,935,3]},{"path":[4,19,3,0,1],"span":[852,10,18]},{"path":[4,19,3,0,2,0],"span":[876,4,44],"leadingComments":" Identifies which part of the FileDescriptorProto was defined at this\n location.\n\n Each element is a field number or an index.

For each unique\n data fingerprint applied to the filter, you can imagine throwing colored die at the cheese cloth - what you end up\n with is some blend of colors, which is entirely unique and ephemeral, having been constituted entirely by the colors\n you chose, and the exact parameters of how you threw them. Albeit a contrived example, one could then imagine simply\n examining the result of your work to determine the presence of different colors.\n\n Bloom filters work the same way. Since their invention in by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, many exotic forms of Bloom\n filters have shown up, a few of which this structure supports.
