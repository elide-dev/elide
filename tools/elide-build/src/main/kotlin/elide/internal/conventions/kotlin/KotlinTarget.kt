/**
 * Defines a target platform supported by the Kotlin Gradle Plugin. This sealed hierarchy is meant to be used with
 * the [kotlin][elide.internal.conventions.ElideBuildExtension.Kotlin] convention DSL.
 *
 * Pure projects may use individual objects like [KotlinTarget.JVM]. To create a multiplatform target, simply add
 * multiple targets:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // will produce a KMP project with Jvm and Native targets
 * target = JVM + Native
 *
 * // will produce a KMP project with both JS targets
 * target = JsBrowser + JsNode
 * ```
 *
 * For KMP projects targeting every available platform, use the [KotlinTarget.All] property, which is computed lazily.
