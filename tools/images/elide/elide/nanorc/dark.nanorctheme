#
# This file describes a default scheme for nanorc syntax highlighting for terminals with dark background
#
# Lines that start with a # character are comments.
# Comments are ignored. Empty lines are ignored too.  Leading/trailing white
# space characters are removed before theme file is processed.
#
# Each line of the theme file describes a token type and how this token type
# should be colored (highlighted).  The first word on each line is the name
# of the token type. After the name of the token type at least one white space
# character must follow, and then a text and background color
# for the highlighting must be specified, separated by a comma.  No spaces
# are allowed inside color definition (that is, color definition is considered
# a single word, despite a possible comma).
#
# Background color can be omitted (in which case default background color
# of the terminal will be used).  If you are omitting the background color,
# a comma may be omitted also.  Likewise, a text color can be omitted,
# but comma must be present in this case.
