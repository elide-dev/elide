// Defines a structure that is operable as a 1-to-n-layer Bloom filter. NIST (the National Institute of Standards and
// Technology) defines a *"Bloom filter"* as a "data structure with a probabilistic algorithm to quickly test membership
// in a large set using multiple hash functions into a single array of bits."
//
// In essence, a Bloom filter is a very compact set of data, which operates kind of like a cheese cloth. For each unique
// data fingerprint applied to the filter, you can imagine throwing colored die at the cheese cloth - what you end up
// with is some blend of colors, which is entirely unique and ephemeral, having been constituted entirely by the colors
// you chose, and the exact parameters of how you threw them. Albeit a contrived example, one could then imagine simply
// examining the result of your work to determine the presence of different colors.
//
// Bloom filters work the same way. Since their invention in by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, many exotic forms of Bloom
// filters have shown up, a few of which this structure supports. For example, one may choose to enhance regular filters
// with the count of items considered in the filter, making it a *Counting Bloom filter*. Or, one may choose to combine
// multiple filters into one effective filter, which is referred to as a *Layered Bloom filter*.
